1.	What is a domain, and why does my computer need to connect to it?
A domain is a secure network that allows your computer to access shared resources, such as files, printers, and applications, while ensuring proper management and security.

2.	How do I log in to my domain account on my computer?
When you start your computer, enter your domain username and password on the login screen. Your credentials will connect you to the company network.

3.	What should I do if I forget my domain username or password?
Contact the IT support team immediately. They can verify your identity and help reset your credentials.

4.	How can I access shared drives or folders on the network?
Once logged into the domain, go to File Explorer, click This PC, and you’ll see shared drives listed. If you don’t see them, contact IT for access.

To maintain security, only administrators can install software or make certain changes. If you need something installed, contact IT for assistance.
